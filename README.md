# Action
This resume is an example in Action of the skills I have taught myself to perform for others.

In this resume, you will find a multitude of skills in Action, including:

## Javascript

Javascript is the primary language used to create this resume. Javascript is used to write to the database, interact with the database (MongoDB); animate and create interactability with the web pages, such as the ability to pull data from web pages to the database, push data from the database to the webpage, animate DOM objects, build server logic and routing tables, and also construct page templates.

## Web Development Best Practices

This website is a strong way to demonstrate a trial-by-fire of Best Practices. Implementation of version-control, terse programming, program life-cycles, and making efficent use of resources are challenges that are solved building the website from scratch, testing, and maintaining the website.

## Install it and check it out.

If you'd like to grab the server and run your own instance,
	$ git pull git@github.com:molinarikris/action.git
	$ sudo npm install
You will need to make a `/certs` file with your ssl key and certificates. Add these to `bin/www` to enable logins and https:// .

After everything is set up,
	$ npm start #sudo npm start if you use port 80.
