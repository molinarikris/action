# Action
This resume is an example in Action of the skills I have taught myself to perform for others.

In this resume, you will find a multitude of skills in Action, including:

## Javascript

Javascript is the primary language used to create this resume. Javascript is used to write to the database, interact with the database (MongoDB); animate and create interactability with the web pages, such as the ability to pull data from web pages to the database, push data from the database to the webpage, animate DOM objects, build server logic and routing tables, and also construct page templates.

## Jade

Jade is the templating language used to create templates and scaffolding for the resume. The resume contains two primary templates (navbar, blog, and resume list).
